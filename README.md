# DeBruijn.Mortality.Watch

This tool visualizes short read genome assembly using the De Bruijn graph algorithm. It showcases the theory behind the complex process of in-silico genome assembly, making it more accessible and understandable. This method was the primary method, that was used during the creation of the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
